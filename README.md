# Family-Inspire
With the FamilyInspire app, we aimed to create an application that allows families to turn dull, monotonous house chores into exciting and rewarding tasks. 
Through a brief study, we have concluded that children benefit from the use of gamification contexts in education. Therefore our primary purpose of helping 
children attain  healthier domestic habits can be achieved more easily by implementing a points-based reward system for completing tasks.
